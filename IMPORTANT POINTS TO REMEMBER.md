(1) Number of prime factors for number n can be found out by [n/p] + [n/p^2] + ......... till p^m where it is smaller than n and p is the prime factor whose frequency is to be determined.
Finding number of zeroes in n!, you need to find the number of 2s and 5s, but finding the frequency of 5s is sufficient as they will be definitely less in number.
