# Number Theory

1. We will make a bitset of 10^7 elements so that it doesn't provide any runtime error. The basic idea to use bitset is to increase the number of prime numbers stored. As a bitset of size 100 will occupy only 100 bits in comparision to a bool or int vector which will use a size of 800 bits and 3200 bits, repectively.

2. If a no is greater than 10^7 that could not be checked using sieve method, we will have to use the native method of checking if the number n is divisible by something till square root of n. So we can make a seperate function which will take the decision.

4. Apart from sieve,
Following are the steps to find all prime factors.
* While n is divisible by 2, print 2 and divide n by 2.
* After step 1, n must be odd. Now start a loop from i = 3 to square root of n. While i divides n, print i and divide n by i. After i fails to divide n, increment i by 2 and continue.
* If n is a prime number and is greater than 2, then n will not become 1 by above two steps. So print n if it is greater than 2.
